        Description
        </h2>
            <p>The glitz, glamour, and unbridled decadence of the 80s are back in Yakuza 0. Fight like hell through Tokyo and Osaka with protagonist <b>Kazuma Kiryu</b> and 
                series regular <b>Goro Majima</b>. Play as Kazuma Kiryu and discover how he finds himself in a world of trouble when a simple debt collection goes wrong and 
                his mark winds up murdered. Then, step into the silver-toed shoes of Goro Majima and explore his “normal” life as the proprietor of a cabaret club.
                Switch between three different fighting styles instantaneously and beat up all manner of goons, thugs, hoodlums, and lowlifes. Take combat up a notch by
                using environmental objects such as bicycles, sign posts, and car doors for bone-crunching combos and savage take-downs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fighting is not the only way to kill time in 1988’s Japan: from discos and hostess clubs to classic SEGA arcades, there are tons of distractions to pursue 
                in the richly detailed, neon-lit world.

        <blockquote>
            A wondrous melting pot of Japanese cultural excess distilled into a relentlessly compelling synergy of RPG and action elements, 
            Yakuza 0 arguably represents the consummate entry point for newcomers to the series. Without a doubt, Yakuza 0 is a masterpiece and the 
            first must-have title of the year. -- <a href="https://www.psu.com/reviews/yakuza-0-review-ps4/">psu.com/reviews/yakuza-0-review-ps4/</a>
