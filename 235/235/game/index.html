        </h2>
            <p>Dig Dug is a <b>1-2 player</b> arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
            Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <i>Pooka and Fygar</i>, who will continually chase you around. 
            The only weapon that you carry is an <i>air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode.</p>
